# Personal-Portfolio

The code in this repository has been used to build my portfolio website, which I consider to be a life-changing project.

## Problem Description

Before creating my portfolio website, I faced the challenge of effectively showcasing my skills, projects, and experiences as an IT professional. I wanted a platform that could present my work in an organized and visually appealing manner to potential employers and clients.

## Approach

To tackle this problem, I decided to build a personal portfolio website. I used a combination of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to design and create a responsive and user-friendly website. The website includes sections such as an about me page, a list of my projects, my skills, and a contact form.

This project was life-changing for me because it not only improved my web development skills but also allowed me to present my work in a professional and impressive manner. It gave me the confidence to showcase my abilities to the world and opened up numerous opportunities for networking and career growth.
